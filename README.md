# git-frontend

Next.js starter with Tailwind CSS and `@solana/kit` for wallet connection and Solana hooks.

## Getting Started

```shell
npx -y create-solana-dapp@latest -t solana-foundation/templates/kit/git-frontend
```

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Solana RPC configuration

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_MAINNET_RPC_URL` and/or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_DEVNET_RPC_URL` before building to override the corresponding Solana endpoint. The selected endpoint is shared by the wallet connection and SDK. When unset, the existing endpoint remains the default; EVM networks are unaffected.

These values are included in the browser bundle. Use a browser-authorized endpoint or a controlled RPC proxy, not a private server credential. Restart the development server after changing `.env.local`.
